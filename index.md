### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was the HiLo Game was one of my favorite codes to write. It was finally when I started getting into the groove of programming and it was a very good learning experience. Especially when we began learning how to use “if” and “else if” statements.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, Part 1 was a second favorite as we literally made a sandwich using code.The process of learning to use strings in a different lab, to contain parts of a sandwich and assemble them together later in the terminal, was incredibly fun. I will say though I did get quite hungry during the process.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, Part 2 was one of the more game-like programs, and for that I liked it a lot. I was able to relate a lot of the code to the way a particular game I enjoy called Inscryption, works, as it too is a card game. To create a card game using only programs was definitely a step in the right direction for my personal path, as I would like to become a game developer. And again being able to learn and apply prior knowledge about “if” and “else if” statements was definitely eye-opening.
